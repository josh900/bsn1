Welcome to the BrightSign Partner Packet! This document serves as an introductory guide for the integration of partner Content Management Systems (CMS) with the BrightSign ecosystem which includes BrightSign’s extensive array of digital signage players as well as a rich set of player management services.

CMS partners are able to build applications that allow their customers to set up, publish to, and manage BrightSign players. BrightSign’s development technologies, including our open APIs, enable seamless partner integrations.

We offer services and support from multiple worldwide locations, and our Partner Integration, Business Development, and Marketing teams are dedicated to helping our partners every step of the way from initial inquiries and on-boarding to market launch.

> BrightSign’s products and services are highly differentiated and function in unique ways. If you are new to BrightSign, it is *highly recommended* that you go through the [Start Here](https://brightsign.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/1968472149/Start+Here) section which provides a quick, high-level overview of how our products and services work.

For partners who already have a good understanding of how our players and services function, let’s get started!

Each page will have a “Next >” link at the bottom which takes you to the next page in the packet. Alternatively, you can skip to any page/section in the packet using the collapsible page tree on the left.
