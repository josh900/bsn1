# BrightSign / Partner Responsibilities

The high-level responsibilities expected of BrightSign and its partners are as follows:

## BrightSign Expectations

*   The BrightSignOS is under continuous development and although we try to provide advance notice and roadmap guidance, the OS may be updated with minimal notice. It is the responsibility of the individual partners to manage player upgrades to ensure OS stability in their environment.
    
*   BrightSign will share code examples to provide guidance to partners, butÂ BrightSign does not write partner-oriented production code.
    
*   BrightSign does not provide quality assurance for partner products.
    

## Partner Expectations

*   Partners are responsible for writing the software that integrates their systems with BrightSign players.
    
*   Partners are responsible for qualifying BrightSignOS updates (see [Update the Player OS](https://brightsign.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/1932492801/Update+the+Player+OS)).
    
*   Partners should have a public web page listing supported BrightSign players.
    
*   Refer to the earlier sections in this document on technical and operational best practices to optimize your BrightSign partner experience.
