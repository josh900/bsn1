# Integrating with BrightSign

As was shown in the hands-on example, BrightSign players can be provisioned by manually copying the necessary files to each playerâ€™s storage device. While this approach may be feasible for small numbers of easily accessible players requiring infrequent content updates, the manual approach quickly becomes untenable with larger networks of players that may be difficult to access and/or situations in which regular content updates are desired.

To fully take advantage of BrightSign offerings, partners are encouraged to utilize the many powerful tools BrightSign offers that help streamline the deployment and management of players.
