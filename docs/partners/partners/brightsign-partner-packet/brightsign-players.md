# BrightSign Players

BrightSign players run on a highly efficient, embedded system specifically designed for connectivity and the processing of media files. Our players are purpose-built from the ground up for digital signage!

## Software

The BrightSign operating system (BrightSignOS or BOS) is an open-source Linux-based OS based on the Yocto and OpenEmbedded projects. It includes substantial BrightSign modifications that include a read-only root filesystem in flash memory, a Chromium rendering engine, and additional components for audio/video processing and security.

Thanks to the built-in Chromium engine, BrightSign players are able to run any HTML/JavaScript application.

BrightSign players are highly specialized and although they are based on a Linux OS, they are *not* general-purpose Linux PCs. They cannot run Linux apps nor are they capable of running apps for Android, iOS, or Windows. However, if you have a native Android, iOS, or Windows app, we may be able to help you leverage your existing code to run natively on our players.

Some of BrightSign’s software components are open source, and the open source code is freely available on BrightSign’s website. See [BrightSign Open Source Resources](https://brightsign.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/2378039297/BrightSign+Open+Source+Resources) for more information.

> Note that the term “firmware” is occasionally used in BrightSign’s documentation. “Firmware” refers to BrightSignOS.

## Hardware

BrightSign players are compact, highly-efficient, and, because they’re fan-less, virtually silent. Performance is maximized by running all video decoding and encoding through dedicated hardware.

With an efficient heat-dissipating enclosure and no moving parts that can break down, BrightSign players are extremely reliable even when they're running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Indeed, the reliability and longevity of BrightSign players are widely viewed as unmatched in the industry.
