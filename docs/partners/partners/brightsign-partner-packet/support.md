# Support

As you dive into the details of your integration, technical questions will inevitably arise. Many questions can be answered on our [support site](https://support.brightsign.biz/hc/en-us).

If more assistance is needed, we are here to help and have created a ticketing system to help manage and track issues. The ticketing system ensures efficient routing of issues directly to the relevant teams within BrightSign and makes it easier for all parties involved to stay updated on issue status.

New issues and questions should be emailed to [integrations@brightsign.biz](http://support@brightsign.biz/) which will trigger a new ticket to be created. A few important things to keep in mind:

*   Each new issue or question you or your team has should be generated as a new ticket. To create a new ticket, email [integrations@brightsign.biz](http://support@brightsign.biz/). Any messages coming from your email domain gets automatically routed to a priority queue for partners.
    
    *   Please refer to the next section for tips on [how to create a good support ticket](./support/writing-a-good-support-ticket.md). Providing the necessary details on your ticket from the outset will help get your ticket resolved as efficiently as possible.
        
*   To reply to tickets, simply reply to the email sent by the ticketing system.
    
*   The ticketing system can also be accessed via a web UI. Generally speaking, the primary benefit of the web UI is to view all open items. In most cases, it is easiest to just reply to the emails from the ticketing system.
