# Developer Setup

As a new developer in the BrightSign ecosystem, there are several items that will help get you up and running as efficiently as possible. Mandatory items include everything listed in the earlier hands-on examples, listed again here for convenience:

*   BrightSign player and associated power supply
    
*   microSD or other storage device
    
    *   If using a microSD card as the storage device, you will also likely need microSD card adapter (computers with standard SD card readers typically require an adapter to access microSD cards)
        
*   Mac or PC
    
*   Display
    
*   HDMI cable (connects the player to the display)
    

In addition, it is very useful to connect the player to the local network via an Ethernet cable or, if the player has the appropriate hardware, WiFi.

## BrightSign Shell and BrightScript Debugger

Partners may also find the BrightSign Shell and BrightScript Debugger to be very useful for development purposes. The BrightSign Shell is a command-line interface (CLI) that enables interaction with the BrightSignOS (BOS), the operating system that powers all BrightSign players. The BrightScript Debugger is a CLI which enables interaction with the BrightScript Interpreter.

The [BrightSign Shell page](https://brightsign.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/1988100153/BrightSign+Shell) contains info about the various ways to access the Shell, specifics on the type of cable to use if you prefer a physical connection to the player, commands, troubleshooting, and more.

The [BrightSign Debugger page](https://brightsign.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/2171994116/BrightScript+Debugger) contains info about how to enable and access the Debugger, commands, troubleshooting, and more.

## Local DWS

The Diagnostic Web Server (DWS) is a powerful tool that enables inspection of various player settings and diagnostic details. Both a Local Diagnostic Web Server (LDWS, accessible over the local network via the playerâ€™s IP address) and Remote Diagnostic Web Server (RDWS, accessible via either bsn.Control or bsn.Content at bsn.cloud) are available. General info about the DWS can be found [here](https://brightsign.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/370673541/Diagnostic+Web+Server) and more specific info about the RDWS can be found [here](https://brightsign.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/404620688/Remote+Diagnostic+Web+Server).

[Local DWS APIs](https://brightsign.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/1172734089/Local+DWS+APIs) also exist to enable direct access to DWS functionality.

## VSCode

Visual Studio Code is a popular coding environment for BrightSign development. The [BrightScript Language](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RokuCommunity.brightscript) extension facilitates coding in BrightScript and is used by thousands of developers around the world.
