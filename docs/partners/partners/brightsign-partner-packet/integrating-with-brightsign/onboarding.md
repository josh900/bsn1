# Onboarding

Every partner has different needs and perspectives, so meeting with our Partner Integration and Engineering team can help us put you on a path best suited for your needs. Connect with the team at [integrations@brightsign.biz](mailto:integrations@brightsign.biz) to get started creating an integration plan.

New partners typically follow this process to integrate with BrightSign:

1.  Sign NDAs.
    
2.  BrightSign shares relevant documentation.
    
3.  After the documentation has been read, a technical call can be set up to discuss the technical details of the integration.
    
4.  The partner develops their integration for BrightSign players.
    
5.  If technical issues arise during development, BrightSign can provide support through our ticketing system.
    
6.  The partner tests and approves their code.
    
7.  When the technical integration is complete, the partner fills out the self-certification form which is required for any co-marketing activities with BrightSign.
    
8.  The integration is packaged and handed over to the go-to-market teams.
    

To maximize the chances for a successful integration, we recommend that you adhere to our guidelines for Technical Best Practices.
