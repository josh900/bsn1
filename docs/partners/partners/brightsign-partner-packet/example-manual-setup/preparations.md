# Preparations

First, you will need to gather the necessary materials in order to follow along with this example.

## What You Will Need

*   BrightSign player and associated power supply
    
*   microSD (µSD) or other storage device (a microSD card will be assumed for this guide)
    
    *   microSD card adapter (computers with standard SD card readers typically require an adapter to access microSD cards)
        
*   Mac or PC
    
*   Display
    
*   HDMI cable (connects the player to the display)
    

## Storage Preparation

Make sure the card is properly formatted as described [here](https://brightsign.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/1967783990/Player+Storage#microSD-Card-Formatting).

## Player Preparation

If your player is brand new, your player should be ready to proceed.

> [!WARNING]
> If you have previously set up your player, it may have some residual settings that need to be reset. In particular, if your player was previously configured for use with the bsn.Content (perhaps to evaluate the service using our free trial), the player will attempt to connect to and set itself up with bsn.Content. Refer [here](https://brightsign.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/395313614/Device+Provisioning#Reprovisioning) for instructions on how to delete the player’s provisioning record and then return here to proceed.
