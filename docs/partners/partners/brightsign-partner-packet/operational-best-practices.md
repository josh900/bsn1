# Operational Best Practices

Based on our experience, partners that follow these practices have the most successful BrightSign integrations:

*   We encourage you to report any issues so that we can help you resolve them. Contact [integrations@brightsign.biz](mailto:integrations@brightsign.biz) for support.
    
*   If integration issues arise, the partner should be the one that communicates with our support team, not the partner’s customers.
    
*   To ensure ongoing alignment between BrightSign’s technologies and partners' goals, we encourage partners to be proactive and talk to us before making major changes to their existing integration(s).
    
*   Partners should be aware that BrightSign may not fully test experimental features in components such as Chromium. If experimental features are used as part of the integration, stability may be adversely affected.
    

Next, we will cover the responsibilities expected of BrightSign and our partners.
