# HTML Development

BrightSign players feature the Chromium HTML rendering engine, allowing you to display local or remote HTML pages. You can use a single, full-screen page of HTML content as a presentation, or you can display HTML content within one or more BrightAuthor zones along with other multimedia content. This feature greatly increases your creative options when using BrightSign players.

The contained pages are not general-purpose instructions for writing HTML code or using HTML publishing software, but you can use these sections to get the most out of your HTML presentations and ensure that your HTML content works seamlessly with your BrightSign players.
