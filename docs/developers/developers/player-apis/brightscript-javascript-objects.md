# BrightScript-JavaScript Objects

> [!WARNING]
> New applications should avoid using BrightScript objects and should use [JavaScript API](../player-apis/javascript-apis.md) objects instead. See the [BrightScript-JavaScript Migration Guide](../player-apis/brightscript-javascript-migration-guide.md) for the mapping between BrightScript and JavaScript APIs.

The BrightSign HTML engine exposes several platform-specific JavaScript objects, which allow you to integrate your HTML content with hardware interfaces and system functions on the player. These objects allow you to link many standard interactive, database, and hardware elements (serial, CEC, device info, etc.) to HTML pages.

This section details the functions and parameters for each JavaScript object. For more information about the BrightScript objects that the JavaScript objects are linked to, see the [BrightScript](../../developers/brightscript.md)Â section.
